   <font size="60px"> While Typhoon Uwan (Fung-wong) is already out of the Philippine Area of Responsibility, <br>it will still trigger rain and winds in parts of the country on Tuesday, November 11.<br> It will also eventually head for Taiwan, inside PAR.<br>
MANILA, Philippines – Typhoon Uwan (Fung-wong) left the Philippine Area of Responsibility at 1:30 am on Tuesday, November 11,<br> but it is still affecting parts of the country due to its size.<br> It is also expected to reenter PAR and head for Taiwan.<br>
<br>
As of 4 am, Uwan was already 365 kilometers west of Calayan, Cagayan, moving north at 15 kilometers per hour (km/h).<br>

The typhoon maintained its strength as it left PAR, with maximum sustained winds of 120 km/h and gustiness of up to 150 km/h.<br>

The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical, and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) said moderate to heavy rain (50-100 millimeters) from Uwan may still hit Ilocos Norte, Ilocos Sur, La Union, Benguet, and Abra on Tuesday. <br>Floods and landslides remain possible, especially in high-risk areas.<br><br>

Uwan will also continue to trigger bursts of rainfall in the rest of the Ilocos Region, rest of the Cordillera Administrative Region, Cagayan Valley, Central Luzon, Metro Manila, and Calabarzon. The rain could be moderate to at times heavy.<br>

The trough or extension of the typhoon can cause scattered rain and thunderstorms in Mimaropa, Bicol, and Western Visayas as well. Bicol is among the areas hardest-hit by Uwan as the typhoon brought torrential rain and destructive winds to the region.

<p> A Hint or a Confirmation<br><br>
In the recent Happy Sad Confused podcast the host Josh Horowitz asked Josh Brolin about the possibility of him returning as Thanos in the upcoming Avengers films. <br>To which Brolin responded with enthusiasm saying he is ready and concluded it by saying “’I’ll be there tomorrow”. <br>This reaction sparked a huge discussion amongst the fans on various forums. <br>Some fans are seen speculating that Thanos’ return in Avengers: Doomsday might not be a decent one as the main focus would be on the lead Dr. Doom.<br> The fanbase of Thanos wants him to have a proper return with all his mighty grandeur if there is to be one.
